      <p>Leeds is the largest city in Yorkshire, and started life as a market town in the middle ages. It became a major player in the woollen industry in the 17th century, then expanded during the industrial revolution to become a hub for printing, iron, engineering and more. Today it is a vibrant multicultural city, with a fantastic offering of shops, bars and restaurants, and is full of friendly locals, beautiful green spaces, and northern charm.</p>
